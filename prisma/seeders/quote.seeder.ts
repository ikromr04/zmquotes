Thus, this property of primary life determined the main specificity of its further evolution. And the biological organisms that subsequently formed, under the influence of millions of connected and random factors, accordingly, possessed this attribute of self-preservation, the preservation of their biological existence, which meant feeding to stay alive, and consequently, moving to find food, and, more broadly — to struggle for their existence. This very property has left deep imprints on the human species, with both positive and negative aspects, which we must study in greater depth to steer humanity\'s journey in the right direction.',
